In a modern aeroplane the airfoils are called the wings and most of the lift is derived from these surfaces. In contrast to helicopters the wings are fixed to the passenger compartment (airframe) and do not move relative to the frame; thus such a machine is called a fixed-wing aircraft.

After 1940 few planes with more than one airfoil were constructed and these are used by hobbyists or for special purposes. Being heavier than air they depend for their levitation on motion imparted by the thrust from either propellers driven by an engine or in a jet plane by the reaction from a high-velocity stream of gases expelled rearward from a jet engine. They start from the ground by a run on small wheels or runners and are guided by a steering apparatus consisting of horizontal and vertical movable planes which usually form part of the wings or tail.
